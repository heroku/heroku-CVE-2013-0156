===

Inspect all of your heroku apps to see if they are running a vulnerable version of Rails

Background
---

A [serious security vulnerability](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/) has been found in the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) framework. This exploit affects nearly all applications running Rails and a patch has been made available.

Rails developers can get a full list of all your affected Heroku applications by running [this script](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-CVE-2013-0156/blob/master/heroku-CVE-2013-0156.rb). The following Rails versions have been patched and deemed safe from this exploit:

- 3.2.11
- 3.1.10
- 3.0.19
- 2.3.15

**If you do not upgrade, an attacker can trivially gain access to your application, its data, and run arbitrary code or commands. Heroku recommends upgrading to a patched version immediately.**
